Internet consists primarily of local area networks. The principle method of communication on the Internet is the TCP/IP protocol suite. The internet however is increasingly becoming an environment with multiple protocols. It has become one of the most powerful and widely available communications mediums on the earth, and our reliance on it increases daily. Government corporations, banks, and schools conduct their day-to-day business over the Internet. With such widespread use, the data that resides on and flows across the network varies from banking and securities transactions to medical records, proprietary data, and personal correspondence.
A network is a conduit for information, it can be as simple as two tin cans tied together with a string or as complicated as the internet. Networks can develop at various levels i.e. individual (social network), organizational, inter-organizational, and international etc.
The security in computer networks is a rapidly growing area of concern. Most of the valuable information resides on the networks, making the network an inevitable entity for survival. All these small networks are connected further to wide area networks which in turn forms the basis of Internet. The Internet is the worldâ€™s largest collection of networks that reaches universities, government labs, commercial enterprises, and military installations in many countries. 
The main objective of this project is to bring improved network security through automation by: 

Scanning a network, exploring and analyzing vulnerabilities.
Development of a proactive network surveillance framework.
Learning and monitoring network in real time.
